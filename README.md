# homebrew-vulkan

Unless I receive issues requesting this cask be updated to new versions, I'm not planning to update this past version 1.2.162.1.  Since then LunarG made some changes to how the files are distributed and how to install the SDK.  I do not have time to look at the feasibility of updating this cask to use the new LunarG builds.

Given `brew install molten-vk` a try.
